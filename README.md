# Heartbeat Harmony Analyzer

## Overview

The Heartbeat Harmony Analyzer is a project aimed at analyzing heartbeat data using machine learning techniques. This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch, incorporating various algorithms including backpropagation, Resilient Propagation, ADAM Optimizer, and Bayesian Network. Additionally, custom metrics and a data loader have been developed to facilitate the analysis process.

## Features

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):** Implemented from scratch, the MLP forms the core of the heartbeat data analysis.
- **Algorithms:**
  - *Backpropagation:* A classic algorithm used for training neural networks by propagating error gradients backward.
  - *Resilient Propagation:* A variant of backpropagation known for its adaptive learning rate.
  - *ADAM Optimizer:* A popular optimization algorithm that combines momentum and adaptive learning rates.
  - *Bayesian Network:* Utilized for probabilistic modeling and inference, providing insights into the relationship between heartbeat data and health indicators.
- **Custom Metrics:** Developed metrics specifically tailored for evaluating the performance of the heartbeat harmony analyzer.
- **Data Loader:** A custom data loader designed to efficiently load and preprocess heartbeat data for analysis.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/heartbeat-harmony-analyzer.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash

   ```

### Running the Analyzer

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd heartbeat-harmony-analyzer
   ```

2. Run the main script to start the heartbeat analysis:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
